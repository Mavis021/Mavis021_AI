**My Journey into Learning AI**

This repository is a collection of projects I’ve worked on as I learn more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’m still exploring and experimenting with different models and techniques.

## Projects:

1. **Avocado.ipynb**
   - Trying to predict avocado prices using Prophet for time series forecasting.

2. **CNN.ipynb**
   - CiFAR-10 Images Classification Using CNNs

3. **CarSalesPredictionModel.ipynb**
   - Basic regression model to predict car sales using Sequential API from keras

4. **Ensemble.ipynb**
   - Exploring Bagging Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier

5. **FacebookProphet.ipynb**
   - Predicting Crime Rate in Chicago using prophet

6. **LeNetTrafficSignClassify.ipynb**
   - Traffic sign classification using the classic **LeNet** architecture.

7. **MLP_FashionMNIST.ipynb**
   - A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify Fashion MNIST using Pytorch-Ignite

8. **NLP-yelp.ipynb**
   - Classifying Yelp reviews using Naive Bayes and NLTK

9. **NN_with_pytorch_.ipynb**
   - Building a Neural Network from scratch with Pytorch.

10. **Qlearning.ipynb**
   - Exploring with Q-Learning, epsilon-greedy, and UCB algorithms.

11. **SpamFilter.ipynb**
   - A simple email spam filter using Naive Bayes

12. **gan.ipynb**
    - First steps with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

15. **movierecommender.ipynb**
    - A Movie Recommendation System using sentence transformers

This repository is just a snapshot of my learning process. It’s not perfect, and there’s still so much more to explore and improve.  
Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improvement are always appreciated.
